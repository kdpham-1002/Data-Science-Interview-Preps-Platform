## Overview
This project is an interactive learning platform designed to help students and professionals prepare for data science interviews. Inspired by the **Feynman Technique**, the platform encourages users to answer coding interview questions independently before revealing the solutions. The platform was built using **Jupyter Notebooks** and converted to an intuitive web interface, providing an engaging and structured study tool.

## Objectives
1. **Interactive Learning**: Implement a question-and-answer toggle system for self-assessment and active learning.
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Provide resources on Python, SQL, machine learning, and statistics to prepare for technical interviews.
3. **User-Friendly Design**: Create a seamless interface for navigating questions, answers, and explanations.
4. **Efficient Workflow**: Automate the conversion of Jupyter Notebooks to web-ready formats for easy sharing and updates.

## Key Features
- **Feynman Technique Integration**: Encourages users to explain concepts in their own words before viewing solutions.
- **Toggle-Based Q&A**: Users can attempt questions and reveal answers with a simple click, simulating interview scenarios.
- **Dynamic Content Updates**: Nightly batch updates ensure the platform stays current with evolving interview trends.
- **Structured Content**: Covers key topics such as Python programming, SQL queries, machine learning concepts, and data visualization.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, nbconvert for notebook management and processing
- **SQL**: Used to organize and query structured question datasets
- **HTML & CSS**: For building and styling the user interface
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To design and host Q&A content
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
